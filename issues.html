          Roe v. Wade Overturned: Supreme Court Gives States the Right to Outlaw Abortion
        </h2>
        
        <p>
          Change is happening. Except negatively. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          On June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court ruled in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization (JWHO). The ruling upheld Mississippi’s ban on abortion at 15 weeks of pregnancy, overturned Roe v. Wade, and ended the federal constitutional right to abortion in the United States.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          By overturning Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court erased nearly 50 years of precedent. They took away our power to make our own personal medical decisions, and they instead gave that power to lawmakers. The court’s decision most harms Black, Latino, Indigenous, and other people of color — communities for whom systemic racism has long blocked access to opportunity and health care. Now, abortion bans will spread across much of the country.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        The ruling opens the floodgates for states to have the choice to outlaw abortion.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          You should have the right to control your own body.

            Health Care Equity
          </h3>

          <p class="box-text">
            The unrelenting and unprecedented wave of attacks on reproductive health and rights has a devastating effect on the lives of people seeking health care. 
          </p>

          <p class="box-text">
            Women of color, immigrants, and LGBTQ+ people (especially those whose identities intersect) are disproportionately impacted by restrictions on that care. For many, birth control and abortion are out of reach because of their income, where they live, or because their boss objects to it.
          </p>

          <p class="box-text">
            That’s why Planned Parenthood advocacy and political organizations fight to protect reproductive health care for everyone. We refuse to back down.

          Sexual Assault
        </h3>

        <p class="box-text">
          Sexual assault is any sexual contact without consent — including rape. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="box-text">
          Sexual assault can happen to anyone regardless of gender, race, age, sexual orientation, disability, or educational status. To end sexual assault in all communities, young people need quality sex education that helps prevent sexual assault — including lessons about communication, gender norms, consent, and healthy relationships.

          To live in a true democracy where all voices are heard and equally represented, we must secure voting rights for everyone. In this current state of the world, it is more important than ever to know your voting rights.
        </p>
        
        <p class="box-text">
          As equal rights are wavering, keep in mind that the ability to preserve and expand access to reproductive rights rests on the right to vote.
