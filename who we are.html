          A Key Role in Public Health
        </h2>
      
        <p>
          Community is the heart of Planned Parenthood and we strive to be good neighbors in partnership with on-the-ground health and rights organizations. Our expert health care professionals are dedicated to providing high-quality, compassionate, and affordable care for everyone. No matter what. As a leader in sexual and reproductive services, we’re proud to serve the diverse needs of local communities through a national network of over 600 health centers operated by our affiliates.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Planned Parenthood health centers provide a wide range of services — namely preventive care,  including birth control, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, and screenings for cervical and other cancers. Our dedicated doctors, nurses, and support staff take time to not only talk with patients, but to see them for who they are as individuals and support the life they envision for themselves.

          A Leader in the Fight for Reproductive Health, Access, and Rights
        </h2>

        <p>
          Planned Parenthood has 17 million supporters nationwide — activists and donors committed to helping us promote policies that protect and advance access to a full range of sexual and reproductive care and education. The Planned Parenthood Action Network engages activists in all 50 states to stay on top of the issues and get involved with campaigns that advance and protect access to reproductive rights and health.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Planned Parenthood Action Fund — an advocacy and political arm of Planned Parenthood Federation of America — is an independent, nonpartisan, not-for-profit organization for all; it  champions policies that expand people's access to medically accurate care and education as well as the freedom to make their own decisions about sexual and reproductive care. The Action Fund engages in educational and electoral activity, including public education campaigns, grassroots organizing, and legislative advocacy.
