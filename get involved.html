        We are thrilled to welcome the talented Jackie Venson to Houston as our event headliner! Jackie is a multi-instrumentalist, singer/songwriter known far and wide for her complexly beautiful music and blazing guitar skills. Born and raised in Austin, Texas, Jackie has traveled the world playing to massive crowds both as a headliner and as support for major acts such as Gary Clark Jr, Melissa Etheridge, Aloe Blacc, Citizen Cope to name a few. With the disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic, the cancellation of her entire tour schedule, and the wave of social change sweeping across the country in 2020, Jackie committed herself to releasing more music than ever before, connecting with her fans directly. Since then, Jackie has released 2 studio albums, 2 live albums under her name and several electronic albums under her side project titled jackie the robot.

        Our opening act is composed of four voices coalesce, rooted in rhythm. Raised on the North American traditions of blues, folk, and soul and inspired by their world travels, the four women of Ley Line transcend genres and languages. Ley Line creates a global soundscape; blending influences from Brazil, Latin America and West Aftrica.

        Dynamic harmonies run like a current through textures of stand up bass, guitar, ukulele, and world percussion. With strong ties to the world folklore traditions, Ley Line's multilingual compositions evoke the beauty of the human experience through our connection to nature and each other. Ley line is acknowledged by their hometown of Austin, Texas as nominees for the Austin chronicle's 2020 Band of the Year. In 2019 they won a major grant through the artist development program Black Fret and have been featured as "artist of the month" on KUTX.
